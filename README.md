# 🪄 My 3D Portfolio  

Welcome to my world — literally! 🎮  
This is not your average portfolio. Instead of scrolling through walls of text, you get to **explore a 3D virtual room** built with **Three.js**. Each object in the room has a story to tell — click around to uncover my **education, skills, and experiences**.  

## ✨ What’s Inside the Room?  
- 📚 **Bookshelf** → My education journey  
- 💻 **Laptop** → My technical skills  
- 🛠️ **Objects & Tools** → My projects & experiences  
- 🎨 **Decor & Easter Eggs** → A little bit of my personality 😉

## 🛠️ Tech Used  
- **HTML5** – Structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling & layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic & interactivity  
- **Three.js** – The magic that makes the 3D world possible ✨  

_No extra dependencies. Just clean, minimal, and fun._

1. Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-portfolio.git](https://github.com/mavagoncalves/portfolio.git)
